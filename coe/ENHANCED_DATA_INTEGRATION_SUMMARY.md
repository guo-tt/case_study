## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. Run Complete Pipeline
```bash
cd coe
python run_enhanced_data_collection.py
```

### 2. Use Training Datasets
```python
from src.data_collection.training_data_preparator import TrainingDataPreparator

# Initialize preparator
preparator = TrainingDataPreparator()

# Get all training datasets
datasets = preparator.prepare_all_training_datasets()

# Use regression dataset
reg_data = datasets['regression']
X_train = reg_data['X_train']
y_train = reg_data['y_train']

# Use time series dataset
X_ts, y_ts = datasets['time_series']

# Use category-specific dataset
cat_a_data = datasets['regression_Cat_A']
```

### 3. Model Training Examples
```python
# Traditional ML (XGBoost, Random Forest)
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(reg_data['X_train'], reg_data['y_train'])

# Deep Learning (LSTM)
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(12, 30)),
